## üì¶ Installation

1. **Get the latest arch iso**

   - Flash it to a USB
   - Boot from USB
   - If you want to install from a other device, you can do that over SSH. Use "passwd" to create a temporary password for the root user.

   Everything else on default

4. **Start install and when finished enter per chroot**

   - Start sshd service via "sudo systemctl start sshd"

5. **Post arch installation execute the following command with your main user**

```bash
bash <(curl -Lks https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rabume/arch-post-install/main/install)
```

This script requires intereactive input, so you have to be present during the installation.
